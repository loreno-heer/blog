### The best keyboards and keyboard layouts for mathematicians

## Most commonly used symbols in a LaTeX document

Lets start by looking at the most commonly used symbols in a standard
latex document. I got some new papers from arxive and downloaded the source.
I wrote a small programm charfreq.py to check the character frequency:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
from collections import Counter
text = sys.stdin.read()
counts = Counter(text)
counts = sorted(counts.items(), key=lambda t : (t[1],t[0]))
print(counts)
```

Then feed it some latex file:
```shell
cat somefile.tex | ./charfreq.py
```

This outputs some nice statistic and tells me that the most frequently used letters are:

| Letter  | Counts | Letter | Counts | Letter | Counts | Letter   | Counts |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| space   | 6983   | k      | 439    | S      | 87     | <        | 16     |

If a table is too wide, it should condense down and/or scroll horizontally.

----------------

Code snippets like `var foo = "bar";` can be shown inline.

Also, `this should vertically align` ~~`with this`~~ ~~and this~~.

Code can also be shown in a block element.
````
var foo = "bar";
````

Code can also use syntax highlighting.
````Javascript
var foo = "bar";
````

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```Javascript
var foo = "The same thing is true for code with syntax highlighting. A single line of code should horizontally scroll if it is really long.";
```

Inline code inside table cells should still be distinguishable.

| Language    | Code               |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Javascript  | `var foo = "bar";` |
| Ruby        | `foo = "bar"`      |

----------------

Small images should be shown at their actual size.

![](http://placekitten.com/g/300/200/)

Large images should always scale down and fit in the content container.

![](http://placekitten.com/g/1200/800/)

```
This is the final element on the page and there should be no margin below this.
```
