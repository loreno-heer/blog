### The best keyboards and keyboard layouts for mathematicians

## Most commonly used symbols in a LaTeX document

Lets start by looking at the most commonly used symbols in a standard
latex document. I got some new papers from arxive and downloaded the source.
I wrote a small programm charfreq.py to check the character frequency:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
from collections import Counter
text = sys.stdin.read()
counts = Counter(text)
counts = sorted(counts.items(), key=lambda t : (t[1],t[0]))
print(counts)
```

Then feed it some latex file:
```shell
cat somefile.tex | ./charfreq.py
```

This outputs some nice statistic and tells me that the most frequently used letters are:

|Letter|Frequency|
|------|---------|
|space |6983|
|\\ |2551|
|a|1970|
|e|1444|
|}|1308|
|{|1308|
|r|1195|
|(|1089|
|)|1088|
|t|1059|
|p|971|
|c|908|
|o|872|
|n|821|
|newline|816|



Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~. [Links](https://github.com) should be have dotted underlines and solid underlines on hover.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. There should be whitespace between paragraphs. There should be whitespace between paragraphs. There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

###### Heading 6

| What      | Follows         |
|-----------|-----------------|
| A table   | A Heading        |
| A table   | A Heading        |
| A table   | A Heading        |

----------------

There's a horizontal rule above and below this.

Here is an unordered list:

* Salt-n-Pepa
* Bel Biv DeVoe

Tables should have bold headings and alternating shaded rows.

| Artist            | Album           | Year |

| Prince            | Purple Rain     | 1984 |
| Beastie Boys      | License to Ill  | 1986 |

If a table is too wide, it should condense down and/or scroll horizontally.

| Artist            | Album           | Year | Label       | Awards   | Songs     |
|-------------------|-----------------|------|-------------|----------|-----------|

----------------

Code snippets like `var foo = "bar";` can be shown inline.

Also, `this should vertically align` ~~`with this`~~ ~~and this~~.

Code can also be shown in a block element.
````
var foo = "bar";
````

Code can also use syntax highlighting.
````Javascript
var foo = "bar";
````

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```Javascript
var foo = "The same thing is true for code with syntax highlighting. A single line of code should horizontally scroll if it is really long.";
```

Inline code inside table cells should still be distinguishable.

| Language    | Code               |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Javascript  | `var foo = "bar";` |
| Ruby        | `foo = "bar"`      |

----------------

Small images should be shown at their actual size.

![](http://placekitten.com/g/300/200/)

Large images should always scale down and fit in the content container.

![](http://placekitten.com/g/1200/800/)

```
This is the final element on the page and there should be no margin below this.
```
